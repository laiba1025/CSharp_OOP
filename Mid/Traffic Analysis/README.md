### Traffic analysis data of a highway in 2023 is stored in a textfile. A data entry consists of the month, the day, and the number of vehicles observed on that day. Due to some errors, there are no observations from every day of the year. The file is ordered by month and day.

**A sample file:**
<br> 3 5 33456
<br> 3 6 45564
<br> 4 12 50000
<br> 5 12 40000
<br> 5 45 23000
<br> 5 2 20000

**For grade 3:** Which was the busiest day where the number of vehicles was the highest?
<br> **For the sample file the answer is 4 12.**
<br> For grade 3 you have to create a **class which processes one line of the file with a Read() method.**

**For grade 5:** Which was the busiest month where the total number of vehicles was the highest?
<br> **For the sample file the answer is 3.**
<br> For grade 5 you have to create a **custom enumerator class with operations First, Next, Current, and End** to process the content of the file. All the algorithms have to be **algorithmic pattern-based** as it was taught on the labs.
