### Home database of bills is stored in a textfile. A data entry consists of the month, the provider's name (one word), and the paid amount. The file is ordered by date.

**A sample file:**
<br> S TelenorKft 3500
<br> 5 MVMZrt 5432
<br> 7 TelenorKft 3500
<br> 7 SzemÄ›tKt 2300

For grade 3 you have to create a class which processes one line of the file with a ReadD method. For grade 3: How much money was pald to TelenorKft in total?
<br> **For the sample hle the answer is 7000.**
<br> For grade 3 you have to create a **class which processes one line of the file with a Read() method.**

For grade 5: Is there any month where nothing was paid to TelenorKft?
<br> **For the sample file the arswer is no.**
<br> For grade 5 you have to create a **custom enumerator class with operations First, Next, Current, and End** to process the content of the file. All the algorithms have to be **algorithmic pattern-based** as it was taught on the labs.
