### The income statistics of persons are stored in a textfile. A data entry consists of the month, the name of the person, and the income of that person during that month. The file is ordered by date.

**A sample file:**
<br> 1 Johnny 30000
<br> 2 Johnny 500000
<br> 3 Susie 20000
<br> 3 Johnny 10000
<br> 3 Ronnie 20000
<br> 3 Johnny 10000
<br> 4 Johnny 500000
<br> 6 Johnny 45000

For grade 3 you have to create a class which processes one line of the file with a ReadD method. For grade 3: Is there any month where Jhonny earned more than 40,000?
<br> **For the sample file the answer is yes.**

For grade 5: Check if Jhonny earned less than 30,000 each month?
<br> **For the sample file the answer is no**

For grade 5 you have to create a custom enumerator class with operations First, Next,
Current, and End to process the content of the file. All the algorithms have to be algorithmic
pattern-based as it was taught on the labs.
