# Task

### The selling statistics of Sandwiches are stored in a textfile. A data entry consists of the date, the name of the sandwich, and the quantity sold of the sandwich on that day.

**A sample file:**
<br> 2023/05/07 cheeseburger 1210
<br> 2023/05/07 BigMac 450
<br> 2023/06/12 McChicken 223
<br> 2023/06/12 McChicken 123
<br> 2023/06/12 McChicken 13
<br> 2023/05/12 cheeseburger 2311
<br> 2023/05/12 McChicken 1223

For grade 3 you have to create a class which processes one line of the file with a Read method. For grade 3: How much total McChicken were sold?
<br> **For the sample file the answer is 2792.**

For grade 5: Which day the quantity of each sandwich sold was more than 1000?
<br> **For the sample file the answer is 2023/05/12.**

For grade 5 you have to create a custom enumerator class with operations First, Next,
Current, and End to process the content of the file. All the algorithms have to be algorithmic
pattern-based as it was taught on the labs.
