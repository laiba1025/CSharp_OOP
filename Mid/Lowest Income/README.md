### The selling statistics of OBI are stored in a textfile. A data entry consists of the date, the name of the department (one word), and the total income of that department on that day. The file is ordered by date.

**A sample file:**
<br> 2023/03/02 KitcHen 25000
<br> 2023/03/02 ElectronicTools 34000
<br> 2023/03/04 Kitchen 24000
<br> 2023/03/04 Painting 12000

For grade 3 you have to create a class which processes one line of the file with a ReadD method. For grade 3: How much money was pald to TelenorKft in total?
<br> **For the sample file the answer is no.**

For grade 5: Which is the worst day with the lowest total income?
<br> **For the sample file the answer is 2023/03/04.**

For grade 5 you have to create a custom enumerator class with operations First, Next,
Current, and End to process the content of the file. All the algorithms have to be algorithmic
pattern-based as it was taught on the labs.
