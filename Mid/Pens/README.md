# Task

### Database of a pen store is stored in a text file. One database element consists of the brand of the pen, the color of the pen and the number of pieces the store has of this pen.
#### The file is ordered by brand and you can suppose that it is not empty. One color of one brand cannot be found in multiple lines.

**A sample file:**
<br> Parker red 40
<br> Parker blue 70
<br> Stabilo green 20
<br> Stabilo blue 5
<br> Stabilo orange 20

**For grade 3** Has the store run out of Stabilo and later pens according to the file? Run out of means that there are less than 5 pieces of each color. You have to define a method for reading from the file and you have to create an algorithm which is based on the general algorithm of the algorithmic patterns.
<br> **For the sample file the answer is no.**

**For grade 5:** Which brands have more than 70 pens in the database? You have to create a class with methods first(), next(), current(), and end() for enumerating the total number of pens for each brand. Other public methods cannot be created for this class.
<br> **In the sample file the output is Parker**

**Requirements for both levels:** You cannot store multiple lines of the file and you can open the file only once.
