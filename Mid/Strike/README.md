# Task

### Traffic analysis data of a highway in 2023 is stored in a textfile. A data entry consists of the month, the day, and the number of vehicles observed on that day. Due to some errors, there are no observations from every day of the year. The file is ordered by month and day.

**A sample file:**
<br> 1 nicky 10
<br> 1 Smithy 8
<br> 1 Smithy 2
<br> 2 nicky 10
<br> 2 Smithy 10
<br> 3 nicky 10
<br> 3 Smithy 4
<br> 3 Smithy 6

**For grade 3:** How many strikes (shots of 10 points) are scored after the first strike of Smithy? You have to define a method for reading from the file and you have to create an algorithm which is based on the general algorithm of the algorithmic patterns.

<br> **In the sample file, the answer is 1.**
<br> For grade 3 you have to create a **class which processes one line of the file with a Read() method.**

**For grade 5:** Was there strike in each round? You have to create a class with methods first(), next(), current(), and end() for enumerating for each round if there was a strike in it. Other public methods cannot be created for this class.

<br> **In the sample file the output is yes.**
<br> For grade 5 you have to create a **custom enumerator class with operations First, Next, Current, and End** to process the content of the file. All the algorithms have to be **algorithmic pattern-based** as it was taught on the labs.
