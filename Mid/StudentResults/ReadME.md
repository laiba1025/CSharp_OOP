### Exam results are stored in a text file. One exam result consists of a neptun code and a grade.

The file is ordered by neptun code.

**A sample file:**

<br> AAAAAA 1
<br> AAAAAA 5
<br> AAAAAB 4
<br> AAAAAC 3

For grade 3: How many Excellent (5) grades there were after the first fail (1)? You have to define a method for reading from the file and you have to create an algorithm which is based on the general algorithm of the algorithmic patterns.
<br> **For the sample file the answer is 1.**

For grade 5: What is the highest number of attempts that a student has taken? You have to create a class with methods first(), next(), current(), and end() for enumerating the number of attempts for each student. Other public methods cannot be created for this class.
<br> **F the sample file AAAAAA had 2 attempts, the other students had 1, so the answer is 2**
