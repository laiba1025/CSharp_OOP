## Spartan For Grade 5
### Model a race of Spartan Race Hungary. The task for grade 3 is extended: there are competitors who can register for the race. A competitor has an ID, a name, and a gender. The race results stored differently: not only the competitor ID is stored, but a reference to the concrete competitor. Only those competitors can participate in the race and have race results who have previously registered for the race. It is possible that a registered competitor does not have any result because of injury or sickness. 
### The new and modified questions to answer:
### <br> 1. Define the winner of a category for a given gender. 
### <br> 2. Decide if a competitor has won in a given category in his/her gender.
