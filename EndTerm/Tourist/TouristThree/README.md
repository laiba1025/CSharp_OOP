Given a city which consists of districts. Each district has a name and its wonders. A wonder max be a museum, cathedral, or castle. A wonder has x and y coordinates, its year of construction, and its level of interest. The expected time spent at each wonder is calculated as a factor number multiplied by its level of interest. 
The factor is calculated as in the following plan. Implement the following plan and answer the following questions: 
1. How much is the biggest distance between two wonders in a district? 
2. Give the district where a given wonder is in! 
The program should write out the answer for these questions, where the district’s index for the first question is the first data of the input file. The second two numbers in the input file store the coordinates of the wonder which is searched in the districts (2nd question).
The rest of the file describes the districts and their wonders in the following structure:
districtName wonderCount 
type coordX coordY interestLevel yearOfBuild 
…
where districtName represents the name of the district, wonderCount stores the number of wonders in that district, type means the type of the wonder (museum/cathedral/castle), coordX and coordY denote the coordinates of the wonder, interestLevel stands for the level of interest for the wonder, and finally, yearOfBuild shows the year in which the wonder was constructed.
