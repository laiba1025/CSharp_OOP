### For Grade 5 
Model football trading cards for kids. The task for grade 3 is extended: there are normal and special cards (for the player of the week and the player of the year). The special cards have a boost on their properties. For a player of the week: a defender’s defense is 
increased by 4, an attacker’s shots are greater by 2, and a midfielder’s number of passes get 3 extra passes. For a player of the year: a defender’s defense is increased by 4, an attacker’s shots are greater by 7, and a midfielder’s number of passes get 6 extra passes. 
The cost for each special card is also increased by the above detailed number. 

For each card it has to be given if it is special or not. The properties are calculated based on the type of specialty. 
                      <br>• How much the most expensive special card’s player cost? 

An UML class diagram is given, which solves the given task, implement it! The diagram is attached in vector graphic format, too. Note that this plan does not satisfy the SOLID principles of OOP.

Parts to modify: CardType class, its children, and its relations, MyCard’s MostExpensiveSpecialCost() function, Card’s and its children’s constructor, Card’s getter for CardType.
