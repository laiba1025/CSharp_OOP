### For Grade 3 
Model the football trading cards for kids. There is a binder for the cards in which the cards can be stored. Each card stores the data of a soccer player: the cost, the defense value, the number of shots, and the number of passes. There are 3 types of players so 3 types of cards: defender, attacker, and midfielder. The cards can be rated: a defender’s rate means its defense value, the attacker’s rate means its number of shots, and the midfielder is rated by the number of passes. We also store the name and the nationality of each player. 
<br>• What is the average rating of the possessed cards? 
<br>• How many English players are there in the card pack? 
<br>• What are the names of all of the English players? 
<br>• Which Spanish player has the best rating? 
<br>• Is there an expensive player who costs more than 1.000.000 euros? 

<br>An UML class diagram is given, which solves the given task, implement it! The diagram is attached in vector graphic format, too. Note that this plan does not satisfy the SOLID principles of OOP.
