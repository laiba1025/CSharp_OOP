# STARWARS
### A starship has a name. If it protects a planet, the planet is also known. It has 3 properties: its armour (natural number), its shield (natural number), and the number of guardsmen on the ship. There are 3 types of ship: the destroyer, the transport, and the ironclad. The power of a ship depends on its type and its properties:
<br> . The destroyer' power is given as the half of its shield.
<br> . The transport's power means the number of guardsmen on it.
