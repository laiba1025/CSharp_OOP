### For Grade 5 
Long time ago in a galaxy far-far away there was a war between the Galactic Empire and the Separatists. The goal is to simulate the battles between these two forces. 
Extend the task for grade 3 with a class which can simulate multiple battles. New battles can be added to this class, new ships can be added to the battles, the number of total destroyed ships can be calculated, and it can be get which battle brought the biggest victory to a party (won battle with the greatest number of alive ships). 
<br>An UML class diagram is given, which solves the given task, implement it! The diagram is attached in vector graphic format, too. Note that this plan does not satisfy the SOLID principles of OOP.
