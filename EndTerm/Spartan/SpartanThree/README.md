#### For Grade 3 
Model a race of Spartan Race Hungary. The race has a place and an organization year. It is stored which categories were organized on this race. The categories may be sprint, super, and beast. It is not sure that all of them were organized, but there is at least one category. A competitor may participate once in any category (even in multiple categories) that was organized. The race results are also stored. A result consists of the ID of the competitor, the category, the minutes, and the seconds in which the competitor has finished the race in that category. 
1. Give the most popular category in which the greatest number of competitors have finished. 
2. Define the winner of a category.
An UML class diagram is given, which solves the given task, implement it! The diagram is attached in vector graphic format, too. Note that this plan does not satisfy the SOLID principles of OOP.
